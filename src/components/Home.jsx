        <p >
        Full stack developer and recent graduate in Computer Science with practical experience in Android development through a three-month internship, where I focused on API handling, backend development with PHP and MySQL, and designing layouts for Android apps. I further advanced my skills as a MERN stack developer, leading a team to create a timetable generation system using genetic algorithms. My expertise also extends to batch management systems, where I implemented student record management with JWT authentication and CORS policies. Additionally, I've worked with Spring Boot and React Native, enhancing my ability to build robust web applications and collaborate effectively across teams.
